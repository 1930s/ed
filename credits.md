As many open source projects, Ed is the work of community. The project starts with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and their wonderful team, who wrangled Ruby in our favor. The theme stylesheets are built on top of [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a Jekyll theme based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), "the Jekyll butler," both created by [Mark Otto](<https://github.com/mdo) and distributed with an MIT license. Thanks to Mark Otto for his helpful streamlining! The jekyll-scholar gem by [Sylvester Keil](https://github.com/inukshuk/) was part of our thinking from the beginning. Necessary hat tip to brother in markdown arms, [Chris Forster](https://github.com/c-forster). 

Of course, projects like this also need a focused core team. Here's ours:

## Terry Catapano
Metadata ninja

## Alex Gil
A suppliant at the altar of minimal computing

## Johann Gillium
Search master and reality checker
