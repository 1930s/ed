- O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done ;[^fn1]
- The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won ;
- The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting ;
- While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring : 
- <span class="indent-1">But O heart! heart! heart!</span>
- <span class="indent-2">O the bleeding drops of red,</span> 
- <span class="indent-3">Where on the deck my Caspantain lies,</span> 
- <span class="indent-4">Fallen cold and dead.</span>


- O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells ; 
- Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle[^fn2] trills ;
- For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,
- For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning :
- <span class="indent-1">Here Captain! dear father!</span>
- <span class="indent-2">This arm beneath your head!</span>
- <span class="indent-3">It is some dream that on the deck,</span>
- <span class="indent-4">You’ve fallen cold and dead.</span>


- My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still ;
- My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will ;
- The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done ;
- From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won :
- <span class="indent-1">Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</span>
- <span class="indent-2">But I with mournful tread,</span>
- <span class="indent-3">Walk the deck my Captain lies,</span>
- <span class="indent-4">Fallen cold and dead.</span>
