<h1>Minimal editions</h1>
<p>One of our most pressing and ever revolving needs as scholars is to pass on our textual artifacts from one generation to another. The art of textual editing, among other practices, has helped us to remember and interpret for centuries. Alas, that art is practiced and encouraged in its highest form by a dwindling number of scholars. In a digital environment the problem is compounded by the difficulties of the medium. While vast repositories appear on the online scene yearly, very few manifest a textual scholar's disciplined attention to detail. Ed is a small, hopeful contribution to our vanishing present.</p>
