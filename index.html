<h1>Minimal editions</h1>
<p>As we see it, a minimal edition is one that reduces elements of the full stack (markup, transformation and presentation) to its bare minimum components given a set of desired functions (reading, searching, annotating, citation, extraction, versioning, etc). Out of-the-box, this theme can help you build a simple reading edition or a traditional scholarly edition with footnotes and references. In our estimate, these are the most immediately useful type of editions for editors. Our hope is that this static-site, plain-text approach can help beginners or veterans deploy editions with less effort, that it can help us [teach a 'full stack'](https://github.com/susannalles/MinimalEditions/blob/master/index.md) in one academic semester, that it can allow us to preserve our projects at less cost and that it may help us generate high-quality editions on github.io in large quantities based on the [git-lit model](http://jonreeve.com/2015/09/introducing-git-lit/) by Jonathan Reeve.</p>
