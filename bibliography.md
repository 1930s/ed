The sample bibliography should display below. If it doesn't, you need to install jekyll-scholar. I've provided a Gemfile for you that you can use with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). Remember to do a bundle install. On that note, I also highly recommend that you use [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to manage your gems. Here's [a great tutorial](https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/ruby-rvm-gemsets-and-bundlergemfiles) on how to do both from Rob Decker.
