## Installing Ed

(For beginners)

To install and use Ed you will be using your terminal. If you need a refresher, I highly recommend "[The Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)" 

N.B. Jekyll does not run very well on Windows machines as of now. If you are using Windows, this theme won't work for you, but we hope that you simply deploy our principles on a system like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which does work on Windows.

The first step to install Ed is to download the source files from Github. To do so you must have git installed in your computer. You probably have git already, but if you don't, here are [some great instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get you started. To make sure git is running on your system enter the following line on your terminal (remember to ignore the $):

~~~ bash
$ git --version
~~~

If you don't get an error, you're good to go. Using the `cd` command on your terminal, navigate to the folder where you keep your web projects. Once you're in the folder where you want Ed to live, download it from github using the following line (remember you can copy and paste):

~~~ bash
$ git clone git@github.com:elotroalex/ed.git
~~~

At this point you should navigate inside your project folder and stay there until further notice:

~~~ bash
$ cd ed
~~~

Jekyll is a Ruby gem (Ruby's name for software packages). Besides Jekyll, Ed needs another  gem to run: jekyll-scholar. I have provided a `Gemfile` that allows you to install the right versions of jekyll and jekyll-scholar. Before you can use this `Gemfile`, you need to setup the right Ruby environment for Ed to run smoothly. The best way to ensure you have the right environment is to use Ruby Version Manager, or [rvm](https://rvm.io/), and the latest stable version of Ruby. To install rvm *and* a recent version of Ruby at the same time, enter the following two lines into your terminal:

~~~ bash
$ gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3

$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
~~~

After the process runs succesfully, read the last few lines generated by the terminal. You will see final instructions for making rvm run. Once you finish the process, check to see if rvm is running by entering:

~~~ bash
$ rvm --version
~~~

If you don't get an error, you're ready for the next step. If you do get an error, and don't feel comfortable troubleshooting on the terminal, this is a good opportunity to reach out to a friend who can help. If you're brave enough, the most effective way of troubleshooting in the terminal is to copy and paste the errors into your search engine of choice.

The next step is to create a gemset for your jekyll projects. A gemset is a set of gems. If you don't create and use a gemset, every gem you install will be applied system-wide. This may cause problems down the line, and I recommend against it. To create a gemset:

~~~ bash
$ rvm gemset create edgems
~~~

To use the gemset you just created:

~~~ bash
$ rvm gemset use edgems
~~~

N.B. Everytime you open a new tab on your terminal, you will need to declare the gemset you want to use, or else it will revert to (default).

Now that rvm and Ruby are set up, we're ready to install our first gem: Bundler. Bundler is a gem that allows you to install many gems at the same time using Gemfiles. Once you install it, you will be ready to run the Gemfile I provided in the source files. To install Bundler:

~~~ bash
$ gem install bundler
~~~

You're very close. Now that Bundler is installed the final step is to install the gems we will need to run Ed: jekyll and jekyll-scholar. To do so run the Gemfile this way:

~~~ bash
$ bundle install
~~~

If you don't get any errors, Ed should work at this point. To see if Ed is working properly we will take advantage of Jekyll's built in server. Assuming you're still inside the ed folder, you can now build the first version of your site and run the jekyll server at the same time by entering:

~~~ bash
$ jekyll serve
~~~

Copy the url on your terminal log and paste it into your browser of choice (I recommend Firefox). This url usually looks something like this `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`. At this point you should be looking at your very own working version of Ed:

![Your very own Ed]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot.png)

## Jekyll

(For beginners)

Ed is a Jekyll theme. That means you will need some familiarity with Jekyll to take advantage of its full potential. While running a Jekyll is a bit more involved than Wordpress and other similar tools, the payoff in the long term is worth the effort to learn it. If you are new to Jekyll I recommend you take a look at ["How (and Why) to Generate a Static Website Using Jekyll"](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/jekyll1/60913) at ProfHacker, and the excellent [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/) to start getting a sense of how it works.

Once you have gone through these tutorials, you can get started using Ed by using the sample texts provided with your own texts. You will probably also want to change the `_config.yml` file to add your own personal information and a site title and description of your choice. to make new texts, simply copy any one of the sample texts as a new file in the `_posts` folder. Remember to always use the jekyll convention for naming posts `yyyy-mm-dd-filename.md`. You should also make sure that all your texts have the YAML front matter (the information at the top of the file). Ex:

~~~ yaml

layout: poem
title: "Cahier d'un retour au pays natal"
author: CÃ©saire

## Kramdown and Markdown

Ed is designed for scholars and amateur editors who want to produce either a clean reading edition or a scholarly annotated edition of a text. The main language we use to write in the Ed environment is kramdown (a flavor of markdown). To learn more about the Markdown family, see Dennis Tenen and Grant Wythoff's "[Sustainable Authorship in Plain Text using Pandoc and Markdown](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)." Kramdown is convenient for scholars because of the way it handles footnotes. You can become familiar with the kramdown syntax in the [kramdown documentation](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html). Another way to become familiar is to examine the sample text source files in your plain text editor. 

---

## Genres

Ed offers three different layouts: poem, narrative and drama. The genre is indicated in the YAML front matter on your texts. Using these layouts will allow you to tweak the stylesheets according to your different needs. Out of the box, Ed contains some special instructions for poetry in it's stylesheets that allow you to deal with some of the peculiarities of poetry layouts.

To indicate lines in poetry we use the line syntax from Kramdown:

~~~ markdown
- Hold fast to dreams
- For if dreams die
- Life is a broken-winged bird
- That cannot fly.
- Hold fast to dreams
- For when dreams go
- Life is a barren field
- Frozen with snow.
~~~

To indent specific lines we take advantage of a feature in kramdown that allows us to indicate classes for a line. This approach still allows the line to be readable while editing. 

~~~ markdown
- {:.indent-3} But O heart! heart! heart!
- {:.indent-4} O the bleeding drops of red,
- {:.indent-5} Where on the deck my Captain lies,
- {:.indent-6} Fallen cold and dead.
~~~

The `-` at the beginning of each line indicates that these are lines. The `{:.indent-3}` is what we need to in order to indicate the indent value for that line. Values can range from 1-10. You can expand the range or adjust the values in the CSS stylesheet in the `public` folder.

The example from Raisin in the Sun shows us that we don't need much special markup for theater as long as we use CAPITAL LETTERS for speakers. Italics for directions are easy enough. Just use `*` around the words you want to italicize. 

The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass shows us an example of narrative that includes footnotes and quoted poetry. See the sections below for how to accomplish these different effects.

## Kramdown and HTML

For more hand-crafted layouts---[the title page in *The Narrative of the Life*]({{ site.baseurl }}/toc/narrative.html#title-page), for example---you may choose to work directly with HTML. One of the great advantages of working with Kramdown is that we have a lot of flexibility to mix HTML with the Kramdown syntax. Here is the code for the title page of *The Narrative of the Life*:

~~~ html
<a id="title-page" />
<p class="centered large">NARRATIVE<br>OF THE<br>LIFE<br>OF</p>
<br>
<p class="centered larger">FREDERICK DOUGLASS</p>
<p class="centered large">AN<br>AMERICAN SLAVE.<br>WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</p>
<br>
<p class="centered">BOSTON</p>
<p class="centered">PUBLISHED AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE,<br>NO. 25 CORNHILL<br>1845</p>
<p class="centered small">ENTERED, ACCORDING TO ACT OF CONGRESS,<br>IN THE YEAR 1845<br>BY FREDERICK DOUGLASS,<br>IN THE CLERK'S OFFICE OF THE DISTRICT COURT<br>OF MASSACHUSETTS.</p>
~~~

The effects of this page can be achieved with slightly complex Kramdown, but I chose to use HTML to demonstrate its use and to highlight the presence of size and center classes in the stylesheet. The use of `<br>` here bears further commenting. In many cases we need to insert and HTML break because Kramdown has the tendency to ignore hard breaks. Feel free to use them whenever you see that the breaks you want are ignored.

## Footnotes

Footnotes are the bread and butter of scholarship. Kramdown makes footnotes a fairly simple affair:


~~~ markdown
- O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells; 
- Rise upâfor you the flag is flungâfor you the bugle[^fn2] trills,

...

[^fn2]: The bugle is a small trumpet implicated in the military industrial complex.
~~~

These footnotes can be placed anywhere, but they will always be generated at the bottom of the document. The footnotes system provided provided by Kramdown does have one limitation. It generates the numeration for you automatically.

---

## Blockquotes

*The Narrative of the Life* also includes several blockquotes. You can also find another example of blockquote use in the footnote of "O Captain! My Captain!" Simple blockquotes are simple enough in Kramdown:

~~~ markdown
> This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my servant, full liberty to go to Baltimore, and spend the Easter holidays.
>
> Written with mine own hand, &c., 1835.<br>
> WILLIAM HAMILTON,
~~~

Things get a bit complicated when we want to use poetry inside the block or when the block is included in another block element, like a footnote. For footnotes see the section below.










> - Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell
> - How pious priests whip Jack and Nell,
> - And women buy and children sell,
> - And preach all sinners down to hell,
> - And sing of heavenly union.
{:.poem}
